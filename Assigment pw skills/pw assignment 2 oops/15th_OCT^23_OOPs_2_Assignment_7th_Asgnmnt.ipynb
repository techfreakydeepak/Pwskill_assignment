    "Abstraction offers several benefits when it comes to code organization and reducing complexity. \n",
    "Let me explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code Organization: Abstraction helps in organizing code by providing a clear separation between the essential features of \n",
    "an object and the underlying implementation details. By hiding the complexity, you can focus on the high-level structure of\n",
    "your code, making it easier to understand and maintain. It also promotes modularity, allowing you to break down your code into\n",
    "smaller, manageable components that can be developed and tested independently.\n",

    "features. This reduces the cognitive load on developers, making it easier to comprehend and work with the codebase. It also\n",
    "helps in managing the complexity of larger projects by providing a higher-level view of the system, allowing you to reason \n",
    "about the interactions between different components without getting lost in the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Code Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by providing a generalized interface or base class that can be\n",
    "extended or implemented by multiple subclasses. This allows you to define common behaviors or attributes once and reuse them\n",
    "across different parts of your codebase. By reusing code, you can save development time, reduce duplication, and ensure\n",
    "consistency in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Maintenance and Scalability: With abstraction, you can easily maintain and update your codebase. By encapsulating \n",
    "implementation details, you can make changes to the underlying code without affecting the higher-level components that rely\n",
    "on it. This makes it easier to fix bugs, add new features, or adapt your code to changing requirements. Additionally, \n",
